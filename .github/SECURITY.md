# Reporting Security Issues

The following code is currently an example that was developed from the redux todomvc example in their [repo](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc). It uses updated toolkit patterns along with example tooling that is used in [dsm23-vite-spa-template](https://github.com/dsm23/dsm23-vite-spa-template). I will take security bugs in future products seriously thus would like to catch any possible future bugs now. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/dsm23/todomvc-redux-example/security/advisories/new) tab.

How to send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report is currently a **TODO**.
